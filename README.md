# RuWarehouse---Project-Using-Priority-Queues-and-Hash-Tables
Project that uses priority queues and hash tables to traverse through a warehouse



Description: 

Congratulations, youâ€™ve just won the lottery and decided to use the money to start a Rutgers merch store! You have some warehouse space to store your inventory, but you are having trouble keeping track of what items you currently have in stock. Your warehouse can store up to 50 different product types, and being a new store, you will be frequently adding new products. You need a structure that can efficiently look up products and delete underperforming ones to make space for new items.
